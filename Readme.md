# Advisor list with GraphQL and Infinity pagination

The application is an improved version of [previous application](https://github.com/allinne/advisor-list). The pagination is cursor-based. This approach is resilient to changes that occur in the list while paginating, as it doesnâ€™t rely on the position of items but rather on a cursor.
